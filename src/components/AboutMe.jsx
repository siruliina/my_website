        <p>
          My name is Siru-Liina Karlin and I graduated in summer 2024 with a bachelor's degree in ICT. 
          I studied in Turku University of Applied Sciences.
          My study path in school was Software Engineering and Project Management.
          The studies involved a lot of teamwork and project work. I was the project manager in some projects
          and learned a lot about the importance of scheduling and thorough planning. I feel like my years as
          a team member in a gymnastics team and me being a coach really helped me in a lot of tasks because I have learned
          how to be an effective part of a team but also take care of others so that they can do their best.
          I am interested especially in frontend coding and UI/UX design, however right now I'm very open to learning
          new things and taking on new challenges. In school I used Figma a lot to plan
          website layouts.
